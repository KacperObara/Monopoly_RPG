This is my first java project. It will be 4 players Monopoly, but with big modifications.
We were inspired by the Metro franchise and the story of Artem's journey (Metro 2033 book and game).
We're aiming for creating a story for every player. They will travel through stations of the post-apocalyptic Moscow metro,
face hard challenges and fight with each other, to survive and conquer all stations for themselves.
